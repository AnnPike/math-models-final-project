# math-models-final-project

The goal of the project is to compare aggregate diffusion on Cartesian grid of different dimensions and equivalent in size Erdős–Rényi networks in Bass model of adopting new products.  We want to explore how spatial structure of a graph influence adoption process. Let the graphs to be homogeneous in coefficient of innovation . Also consider two cases of homogeneity in coefficient of imitation  – ‘in’ and ‘out’.

 simulation.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with all functions for simulations. To find a fraction/influence of a network you need to clarify parameters p, M, nsim. Folders with M, nsim will be created and all the results are saved there.
 
 simulaltions.zip - contain pickles obtained from simulations done for the project

 more_plots.ipynb - Jupyter notebook, in which results from simulations folder are loaded and different graphs are ploted
